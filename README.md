"*One of the best code editor available in the market visual studio code is, yes.*" - Yoda <br>
In a galaxy far, far away, lives a lot of programmers using the force to create beautiful pieces of code. So, for all my fellow Jedi and Sith coders, I am presenting the STAR WARS THEME for Visual Studio Code. With a beautiful blend of all the lightsaber colours, it's time to bring balance in the code.
